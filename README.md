# usb_game12: Firmware for USB game controller with 12 inputs (8 buttons + 4 directions)

usb_game12 is a firmware for Atmel ATmega8 which supports a total of 12 inputs (4 directions
and 8 buttons) to build a game controller. Ideal for Arcade-style controls and other
simple (one-wire-per-button) controllers such as Neo-Geo, Atari, etc.

The device connects to an USB port and appears to the PC as standard HID joystick.

## Supported micro-controller(s)

Currently supported micro-controller(s):

* Atmega8

Adding support for other micro-controllers should be easy, as long as the target has enough
IO pins, enough memory (flash and SRAM) and is supported by V-USB.

## Built with
